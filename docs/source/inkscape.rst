Introducing Inkscape-CutcutGo
-----------------------------

`Inkscape-CutcutGo <https://github.com/virtualabs/inkscape-cutcutgo>`_ is a fork
of an existing Inkscape extension called
`Inkscape-Silhouette <https://github.com/fablabnbg/inkscape-silhouette>`_, written
by JÃ¼rgen Weigert (juergen@fabmail.org) and other contributors.

This extension has been heavily modified to fit Cricut's Maker features, but only
supports Cricut's *Fine Point blades* and pens at the moment.

1. Open your document with inkscape.
  - Note: documents in px are plotted at 96dpi

2. Convert text objects to paths (Path - Convert object to path)
3. Select the parts you want to plot.
4. Open the extension. If you want to use the same cut settings for all of the paths in your file, use "Extensions -> Export -> Send to Cricut"
5. Set your desired plot parameters. There are numerous aspects you can control with the dialog, here are just the core highlights:
  - **X-Offset, Y-Offset**  An additional offset of your drawing from the top left corner. Default is 0/0
  - **Tool**                *Fine-point blade* mode drews small circles for orientation of the blade, Pen mode draws exactly as given.
  - **Media**               Select a predfined media. For now, only "Laser Copy Paper" ,aterial is supported.

6. To start the cut, in "Send to Cricut, click the "Apply" button. If *preview* option has been selected, click the "Cut" button in the next dialog box to start cutting.
